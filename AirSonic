##### Create streaming music server #####

In this tutorial I want show you how to create a streaming music server on Linux.
In my case my hardware platform is Raspberry PI 3, but you can done all this steps on other hardware platforms.

1)Become a root user

2) Install Java
apt install openjdk-8-jre
update-alternatives --config java

3) Download AirSonic
wget https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic/releases/download/v10.3.1/airsonic.war.asc

4) Create a folder for AirSonic and copy software in this folder
mkdir /var/airsonic/
mkdir /var/arisonic/music (folder to contain music)
mv airsonic.war /var/airsonic/

5) Create script to startup AirSonic at boot
cd (just to come back to the root folder)
touch airsonicstart.sh
chmod a+x airsonicstart.sh
nano airsonicstart.sh
Paste the following line in the empty file:

#! /bin/sh
java -jar /var/airsonic/airsonic.war

Save the file

6) Configure rc.local
nano /etc/rc.local

Add the following line before "exit 0":
bash /root/airsonicstart.sh

7) Reboot the system and wait a few minutes

8) Connect to the AirSonic server http://IP_ADDR:8080 or http://localhost:8080
The default password is admin/admin

It works!
